# Self-Defined Project Road Map

## Values & philosophies

These are the values and philosophies that we want to embody in our decision making and our roadmap should always reflect them.

### Design values

- Typography at its core, focused on legibility, performance, and future-proofing for translations/non-Roman alphabets.
- High-contrast colour palette, again for legibility.
- Lack of imagery or ornamentation, given the sensitivity and representation of these communities. Depicting them visually at this time feels reductionist.

### Philosophies

- Maintain OSS nature for non-profit and other OSS uses, but charge for corporate uses.
- Ensure that dictionary includes nuances and expresses that not everyone ascribes to terms exactly as they are; illustrate and articulate those nuances wherever possible.
- Accessibility, inclusion, and performance are at the core of this project.
