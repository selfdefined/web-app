    <p><strong>Open <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr></strong></p>
    <p>Some examples of when you may want to open a <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Correct misspellings</li>
      <li>Fix broken links</li>
      <li>Add definitions/nuance/translations to words that exist on the site already but are undefined/partially defined/could use more nuance</li>
      <li>Resolve issues that already exist</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally speaking, if you know how to open a <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr> in order to fix the issue, doing that is best. However, we recognise that it requires knowledge of GitHub and code to some degree, which is a form of gatekeeping. We're currently working on ways to improve/remove this barrier to entry. We also are always willing to help if you'd like to learn. Reach out via our <a href="//join.slack.com/t/selfdefined/shared_invite/zt-fczgm8b6-8ZZgHvLutNDXo~NjwaL7Iw">Slack community</a></p>
