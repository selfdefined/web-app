This guide will walk you through the current state of the development config. Things get a bit technical here. ðŸ¤–

All file names, except stated differently, are relative to the project root.

We are using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) to generate the site based on the given definitions. As a module bundle we use Parcel.

Weâ€™ve compiled a list of [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/selfdefined/web-app/blob/prod/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you start working on the project.

## Setup

You will need to have Node and Git installed on your machine. To start developing please create a fork of the [root repository](https://github.com/selfdefined/web-app).

Afterwards, install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Thatâ€™s it, actually.

## Development Mode

To start the dev server run this command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start Eleventyâ€™s development server and watch the CSS entry point for changes. The output in the console will show the local URL to use.

### Eleventy Config

Configuration for Eleventy (e.g. filters and collections) are defined in `.eleventy.js`.

## Build

To build the production site run

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a minified CSS bundle as well as run Eleventyâ€™s production build. Build files are located in `dist`.
