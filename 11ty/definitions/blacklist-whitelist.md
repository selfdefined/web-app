To allow or deny access to a service, a privilege, or recognition.

## Issue

Using a color to denote whether an entity is included or excluded from a group draws parallels to the idea that Black and White people have respectively been denied and allowed privileges based on the color of their skin. Similarly to the concept of [master/slave](/definitions/master-slave), blacklist/whitelist is used casually in the realm of software development, which reinforces the exclusion of Black people in the industry.

## Usage Tip

Seek to change any existing "blacklist/whitelist" terminology to one of the suggested terms, which have the advantage of being more descriptive and less jargony.

Even if you may not be negatively impacted by this terminology, it can negatively impact other existing and prospective contributors onto your project. The terminology isn't so unique that it's irreplaceable; the lift tends to be trivial in comparison to the potential impact.
