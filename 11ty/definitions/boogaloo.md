originally a type of music made up of a mix of mambo, cha cha, pachanga, doo-wop and soul, "Boogaloo" has since been appropriated by Alt-Right and White Supremacists groups to refer to a race-based or civil war.

The new use of “Boogaloo” is derived from memes about the film _Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo_, riffing on the title – notably, as “Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo”.

Some Alt-Right members self-identify as "Boogaloo Boys" (or "Bois"), or speak of "preparing / showing up for the Boogaloo". Many dress in Hawaiian shirts and/or military wear to distinguish themselves at protests and gatherings.

## Issues

Similarly to the [OK Hand symbol](/ok-hand.md), the word itself does not have racist origins (and in fact, is a product of the Latin music community) and neither does the original meme (a joke about movie sequels). However, language evolves, and "Boogaloo" has become a term used quite seriouly by Alt-Right and White Supremicist communities.

It should be noted that this approach of indoctrinating symbols of hate is one long-documented, and [used for the Swastika as well](https://theconversation.com/how-nazis-twisted-the-swastika-into-a-symbol-of-hate-83020).

## Impact

Although this was previously a non-violent / non-hateful meme, continuing to use it supports the plausible deniability of those who do use it with serious intent – and may put you in danger of being mistaken for a "Boogaloo Boy".
