the investment in time, effort, and money done by people to manage personal and professional online reputations.

## Origins

Egonomics is first proposed by Thomas Schelling in his paper "Egonomics, or the Art of Self-Management."

"Schelling suggested that individuals suffer from a sort of split-personality disorder whereby the present self wants a specific thing (e.g., eating a cookie) but the future or past self wants a different thing (e.g., losing weight). Both selves exist, but do not exist at the same time."[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egonomics).
