From the [DHH](https://medium.com/dictionary-of-digital-humanities/nerd-b7d61b6f536e): "An overly intellectual person, usually obsessive or lacking social skills, focusing their interests on non-mainstream activities, generally highly technical or related to fiction or fantasy narratives. It is used as a stereotype for either derogatory or praising purposes, depending on who's wielding it."

## Issues

The term can be used in a way that leads to weaponizing a person's passion against them, which may manifest as bullying of that person's appearance or background.

## Impact

By assigning negativity to the passion that someone exhibits for the things they enjoy, we invalidate their individuality and reduce the enjoyment they derive from their passions. As a result, we may cause these people to abandon hobbies or interests, instilling a feeling of wrongness in finding joy how they see fit (provided their methods of finding joy are not harmful).
