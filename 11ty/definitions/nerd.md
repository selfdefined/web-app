"an overly intellectual person, usually obsessive or lacking social skills, focusing their interests on non-mainstream activities, generally highly technical or related to fiction or fantasy narratives. It is used as a stereotype for either derogatory or praising purposes, depending on who's wielding it."
â€“[Dictionary of Digital Humanities](https://medium.com/dictionary-of-digital-humanities/nerd-b7d61b6f536e)

## Self-Identification

Individuals may use this term to self-identify and to indicate their extreme passion for hobbies and interests. Acknowledging this usage and supporting people who self-identify and reclaim this term can validate the way people perceive their passions as it relates to their identity.

## Issues

When used in reference to someone else without their consent, the term can weaponise a person's passion against them, or bully someone based on their appearance or background.

## Impact

By assigning negativity to the passion that someone exhibits for the things they enjoy, we invalidate their individuality and reduce the enjoyment they derive from their passions. As a result, we may cause these people to abandon hobbies or interests, instilling a feeling of wrongness in finding joy how they see fit (provided their methods of finding joy are not harmful).
