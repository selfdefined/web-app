the deliberate act of voluntarily ending one's own life. Motivation for suicide can be the result of conscious or unconscious thoughts and feelings.

## Issues

Commonly referred to in conversation and journalism as "committed suicide", "took their own life", or similar, which can have negative connotations with criminality and judgement, and can place blame on the individual. Can also be used in combination with a related measure of "success" which promotes suicide as a desirable result.

## Impact

Unless used with sensitivity and care, discussion of suicide can reinforce negative stereotypes and stigma around mental illness. Sensationalist reporting of suicide also risks inadvertently promoting suicide.

## Usage Tips
When discussing suicide and suicidal ideation:
- Avoid mentioning details of methods used and suggesting that these are "easy" or "painless" to reduce the risk of imitation. 
- Avoid suggesting that suicide is an "easy way out".
- Avoid speculation over possible triggers: Suicide and suicidal ideation is complex and not necessarily the result of a single event or condition. Attempting to explain away suicide with a specific cause or condition downplays the wider circumstances and the impact on all those affected.
- Instead of saying that a person "committed suicide", say that a person "died by suicide." Framing suicide as a symptom of wider/unknown-to-us conditions validates the individual as a victim, rather than a perpetrator.
- Discussing or reporting on suicide can be an opportunity to signpost the support available and educate people about the importance of mental wellbeing.
