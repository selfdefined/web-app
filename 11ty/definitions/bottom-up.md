## Impact

The term, `bottom-up`, reinforces and even restores a perception of a hierarchy. 

// a potential positive and negative perception is there. however, seems like interpreted subconsciously, without realisation of that acknowledgement

this, wide practice, is prone to self and/or collective acknowledgement and emphasizing a state of being in a
[lower ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5orH1D8mwl0). 

referencing and affirming that (bottom) position as origin to move away, as-is, leaves no space or even further requirement for interpretation. 

## Alternative Usage

to emphasise participatory and open processes for positive change, encouraging collective thinking, decision making and action taking; rather than saying `"let's do it with a bottom-up approach"`, use below alternatives. 

or better, preffering alternatives, that are immune to generating perception of authority, level/hierarchy. 

semantically, and ontologically. eg: 

"let's do it .. 
- in a grassroots fashion"
- together"
- collectively "
- proactively"
