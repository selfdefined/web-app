The act or process of making something capable of causing harm to an individual or group.

## Issues
Weaponize can be used as way to accurately highlight the effect of certain words, systems and behaviours that negatively impact vulnerable groups. Unfortunately, it is also frequently wielded by bad faith actors to make accusations that relatively benign or progressive behaviours are causing harm to themselves, when in fact the actions they claim to be 'weaponized' against them are actually vulnerable groups and allies seeking to prevent or disrupt systematic injustices. The word can be, and frequently is itself, weaponized; instead of being a way of framing the context of aggressive action, it becomes part of the defense of someone who themselves is engaging in an act of aggression. Care should be taken when encountering the word used to discern the context in which it is applied before taking it at face value.

## Impact
Identifying a situation where an action, system, or concept is being weaponized, and explicitly identifying it as such, can be a powerful tool in protecting vulnerable sub groups from further harm, by revealing the existence of sometimes subtle oppressions.

e.g. The reduction of polling locations in certain parts of the country seeks to weaponize the ability to exercise political agency to further disenfranchise the systematically oppressed

## Usage tip
Weaponized should always be used with enough context to make it clear to the reader how the entity being weaponized is causing harm to an individual or group. Use concrete examples and evidence that provide a rational argument as to how the entity can and is being used as a weapon, and the intended target of the attack.
