something which is obscenely cruel; primitive; unsophisticated

## Issues

Barbarian originates from the Greek word _b√°rbaros_ meaning "babbler", to denote the "unintelligible sounds" (_"bar bar bar"_) made by foreign speakers.
Similar words exist in many other languages, for the identical purpose labeling a "strange"/"foreign" person/culture.

In modern day usage, you can notice this rhetoric being employed almost always for the purpose of demonizing "foreign" (more often than not from the global south) cultures - cultures that need to be civilized;
cultures that need to be colonized to rescue them from themselves. A perfect lingual weapon for warmongers and racists alike. Equally repulsive sibling of "savage".

## Impact

When you use words, that are in vogue primarily inside circles of bigots, with racist etymologies, it's a wilful act of violence, ignorance and an indication to the vilified and minoritised communities that their history of wounds and abuses are inconsequential to our words.

## Usage Tip

Avoid words that have obscene etymologies. There is almost always a better alternative: an inclusive and a less hurtful one.
