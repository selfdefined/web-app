Since medieval times, the word "idiot" was used to describe an ignorant person, and from the 14th century specifically someone with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). 

In the early 20th century, the term was adopted by the legal and psychiatric communities to refer to an intellectual disability resulting in function equivalent to a neurotypical two-year old according to contemporary intelligence scales. Like those intelligence measurement systems, the term itself has been replaced in technical settings by more specific medical language.

## Issues

In modern times, "idiot" is rarely used to describe someone with an ID/D, but rather someone who is acting in a manner the speaker finds thoughtless or selfish. Nevertheless, ableist language perpetuates entrenched, dehumanising attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities.

## Alternatives

Since "idiot" is frequently an exclamation of frustration, use a term that describes the frustrating *action* rather than suggesting an ID/D suffered by the *actor*: "I hated it when that driver cut me off in traffic."
