umbrella term encompassing all people from Black, Asian and minoritised ethnic groups living in the UK

## Issues

BAME can be near meaningless as it groups together people who have different cultures and experiences of inequality and racism. "Minority" is also a problematic word for describing peoples because, for example, it (inaccurately) connotes powerlessness and subordination (see [minorities](/definitions/minorities/)).

## Usage Tip

Be more specific wherever possible. Are you referring to Black people? British Pakistanis? Roma? Ask individuals how they identify themselves and use their terms.
