umbrella term for people of East Asian descent. East Asian countries include China, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan

## Considerations
As many countries and cultures are enveloped within this umbrella term, try to be as specific as possible. If you know or can ask someone if they are Japanese, for example, that's better as it's more specific.

Do not assume someone is East Asian because of certain physical characteristics or language knowledge.

Additionally, these Asian subregions are important to differentiate, as some regions were most fraught to imperialism and colonisation than others.
