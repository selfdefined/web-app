colloquially, low-effort rewards, easy wins; racist connotations of lynching

## Issues

The term “low-hanging fruit” has been noted as being reminiscent of the lynching of black people in southern states, particularly because of its similarity to the Abel Meeropol/Billie Holiday song “Strange Fruit”.

## Impact

The use of the term “low-hanging fruit” is seen as a microaggression that evokes racist imagery.

## Usage Tips

Substitute “low-hanging fruit” for alternatives such as: easy wins; low-risk, high-yield; quick wins.
