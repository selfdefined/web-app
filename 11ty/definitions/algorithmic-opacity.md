The effect of an algorithmic system designed in a way that makes difficult to explain why a certain decision was made by it.

An algorithmic system may be kept opaque deliberately to conceal how it operates, unintentionally due to the expert technical knowledge required to understand it, or as result of a mismatch between how humans and algorithms understand the input given.

## Impact

When concealed, this prevents users/consumers from fully understanding what these algorithms can and cannot do. Ultimately, lack of transparency allows for biases to remain unchecked, and this creates potential for additional harm to be done.
