groups, resulting from social constructs, that have been granted less power or representation compared to other members or groups in society

## Preferable To

[minorities](/definitions/minorities)

## Benefits

Minoritised places the emphasis on the power struggle, and on the systemic issues at play. It's also an adjective, which requires you to add "group" or "people" so it's people-first language.

## Impact

It removes the pejorative nature of "minorities", illuminating that this is an effect upon the individual or group, rather than the singular way to identify the group.
