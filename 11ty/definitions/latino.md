Serves as an umbrella term for people of Latin American ancestry. Latino (and Latina) are inherently gendered terms due to Spanish's gendered language. Latino is considered a pan-ethnic term that does not provide context for someone's language, country of origin, or race.

Also can be written in gender neutral forms of [Latinx](/definitions/latinx), or Latin@s. When in doubt, default to Latino, and ask individual parties their preference, if possible.

#### Note

People who self-identify as Latin American or Latino/Latina may also self-identify as Chicano/Chicana, [Hispanic](/definitions/hispanic), or [Latinx](/definitions/latinx).
