## Issues
The term "short bus" upholds several **false** and **[ableist](/definitions/ableism)** ideas:
- Students without I/DD ride exclusively on Type C buses, whereas students with I/DD ride exclusively on Type A and B buses. Type C buses are more abundant, used by nondisabled students, and thus seen as "normal." Type A and B buses are less common, and often used by disabled students, and thus seen as "abnormal," making it the target of jokes (at the expense of disabled students). This idea reiterates disabled as "abnormal" and nondisabled as "normal."
- Type A and B school buses are only used for disabled students, when in reality, they may be used to transport small numbers of students&mdash;often in remote or rural communities&mdash;directly to school or to a hub to transfer to a larger bus.
- Mobility aids and accessibility infrastructure, which tend to be [undersupported and underfunded](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-infrastructure-raw-deal-disabled-20210805-mgmhsqiy4rdtvc3jsgqhvilf5u-story.html), are worthy of mockery. This type of codified insult is one way in which infrastructural issues are reinforced and perpetuated by cultural norms.

The term upholds an ableist sense of normalcy, and furthers the harmful and exclusionary practices that segregate those with an I/DD from the rest of society while depriving them of their dignity.

## Impact

As is the case with any ableist term, "short bus" is a derogatory slur, which is often used synonymously for the the r-word. Regardless of intent, awareness or target of the insult, using this term dehumanises disabled people by mocking perceived low intelligence or capability.

When we use ableist language, we are creating spaces in which we willingly harm those experiencing physical, mental, or psychological disabilities, regardless of our intent.

## Usage/Alt Words

When referring to the smaller bus, use Type C, which is more specific and accurate.

When using it as an insult, it cannot be used constructively. Usage should be reserved to discuss the term itself in an effort to remove it from common usage and reduce its ongoing harm.

In all other situations, use descriptive language to describe the person's output or actions: For example, if someone writes a paper that is factually inaccurate or otherwise lacking in substance, offer a constructive criticism of paper's contents rather than attempt to humiliate them with ableist language that perpetuates harm.

Some examples of phrases that could replace common self-deprecating usages:
- "What a brain fart."
- "Wow, that was so spacey of me."
- "I can't believe I did that. I must be tired."
- "I had a lapse in judgment."

For example, if someone writes a paper that is factually inaccurate or otherwise lacking in substance, offer a constructive criticism of paper's contents rather than attempt to humiliate them with ableist language that perpetuates harm.
