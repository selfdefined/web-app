"Short bus" is a derogatory and ableist term for a [Type A or B school bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_bus#Types). While these school bus types are used to transport smaller groups of students to school or related activities, they may also be used to transport students with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (I/DD). The term is a derogatory shorthand for [the r-word](/r-word/).

## Issues

There are four school bus types ranging from A to D, with the Type C school bus being the conventional vehicle used to transport large numbers of students. The term "short bus" upholds the perception in which students without an I/DD ride exclusively on Type C buses meant for "normal" students, while their "abnormal" peers are relegated to smaller Type A or B buses. This perception ignores the reality that Type A and B school buses may be used to transport small numbers of students&mdash;often in remote or rural communities&mdash;directly to school or to a hub to transfer to a larger bus.

The term upholds an ableist sense of normalcy, and furthers the harmful and exclusionary practices that segregate those with an I/DD from the rest of society while depriving them of their dignity.

## Impact

As is the case with any ableist term, "short bus" is a derogatory synonym for the the r-word that should be avoided. It is dehumanizing slang used by children and adults alike to directly insult disabled people, or mock those without an I/DD for perceived low intelligence or capability at the expense of those who have an I/DD.

When we use ableist language, we are creating spaces in which we willingly harm those experiencing physical, mental, or psychological disabilities, regardless of our intent.

## Alt Words

There is no scenario in which the term "short bus" can be used constructively, unless the intent is to discuss the term itself in an effort to remove it from common usage. In all other situations in which you are describing someone's actions or output, use descriptive language rather than insulting someone at the expense of those with an I/DD.

For example, if someone writes a paper that is factually inaccurate or otherwise lacking in substance, offer a constructive criticism of paper's contents rather than attempt to humiliate them with ableist language that perpetuates harm.
