## Issues
The term "short bus" upholds several **false** and **[ableist](/definitions/ableism)** ideas:
- Students without I/DD ride exclusively on Type C buses, whereas students with I/DD ride exclusively on Type A and B buses. Type C buses are more abundant, used by nondisabled students, and thus seen as "normal." Type A and B buses are less common, and often used by disabled students, and thus seen as "abnormal," making it the target of jokes (at the expense of disabled students). This idea reiterates disabled as "abnormal" and nondisabled as "normal."
- Type A and B school buses are only used for disabled students, when in reality, they may be used to transport small numbers of students&mdash;often in remote or rural communities&mdash;directly to school or to a hub to transfer to a larger bus.
- Mobility aids and accessibility infrastructure, which tend to be [undersupported and underfunded](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-infrastructure-raw-deal-disabled-20210805-mgmhsqiy4rdtvc3jsgqhvilf5u-story.html), are worthy of mockery. This type of codified insult is one way in which infrastructural issues are reinforced and perpetuated by cultural norms.

The term upholds an ableist sense of normalcy, and furthers the harmful and exclusionary practices that segregate those with an I/DD from the rest of society while depriving them of their dignity.

## Impact

As is the case with any ableist term, "short bus" is a derogatory synonym for the the r-word that should be avoided. It is dehumanizing slang used by children and adults alike to directly insult disabled people, or mock those without an I/DD for perceived low intelligence or capability at the expense of those who have an I/DD.

When we use ableist language, we are creating spaces in which we willingly harm those experiencing physical, mental, or psychological disabilities, regardless of our intent.

## Alt Words

There is no scenario in which the term "short bus" can be used constructively, unless the intent is to discuss the term itself in an effort to remove it from common usage. In all other situations in which you are describing someone's actions or output, use descriptive language rather than insulting someone at the expense of those with an I/DD.

For example, if someone writes a paper that is factually inaccurate or otherwise lacking in substance, offer a constructive criticism of paper's contents rather than attempt to humiliate them with ableist language that perpetuates harm.
