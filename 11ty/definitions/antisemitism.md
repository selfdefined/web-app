hostility to, discrimination, or prejudice against Jewish people.

Antisemitism can arise in many different ways, including:

+ racial, which implies that Jews constitute a distinct race or ethnic group with inherent traits or characteristics;
+ economic, which infers certain activities become harmful when performed by Jews, often specifically links Jews and money;
+ religious, which includes discrimination against Jewish religious beliefs and religious teachings by other groups implying the inferiority of Jews;
+ and political, which implies Jews seek national and/or world power.

#### Note

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) addresses the [spelling of 'antisemitism'](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/antisemitism/spelling-antisemitism) instead of 'anti-Semitism'. From the website:

> [...] the conjunction of the prefix ‘anti’ with ‘Semitism’ indicates antisemitism as referring to all people who speak Semitic languages or to all those classified as ‘Semites’. The term has, however, since its inception referred to prejudice against Jews alone.

The unhyphenated spelling is preferred as a way to delegitimize the idea that antiseminism is inclusive of all Semitic people, e.g. Arabs, Assyrians, and Arameans.
