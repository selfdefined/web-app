aggression towards, discrimination, or prejudice against Jewish people.

Antisemitism can arise in many different ways, including:

-  racial, which implies that Jews constitute a distinct race or ethnic group with inherent traits or negative characteristics;
-  economic, which infers certain activities become harmful when performed by Jews, often specifically links Jews and money;
-  religious, which includes discrimination against Jewish religious beliefs and religious teachings by other groups implying the inferiority of Jews;
-  and political, which implies Jews seek national and/or world power.

Antisemitic ideology includes dehuminisation and degradation of Jews, as well as myths which adapt over time.

## How it works

Many groups are oppressed due to a fixed hierarchy, such as anti-Black racism in the United States. Historically, antisemitism has been described as cyclical. Jewish communities rotate between periods of stability, including some success, and periods of increased negative visibility which sometimes lead to violence. This further perpetuates myths about Jewish power.

Antisemitism tends to be most visible when people are forced to compete for scarce resources.

## Origin

Antisemitism began in European Christianity as ideological oppression, and functions to protect the ruling class and divert blame for hardship. While it began as a religious intolerance, antisemitism has always in-part been xenophobic.

#### Note

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) addresses the [spelling of 'antisemitism'](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/antisemitism/spelling-antisemitism), instead of 'anti-Semitism':

"[...] the conjunction of the prefix ‘anti’ with ‘Semitism’ indicates antisemitism as referring to all people who speak Semitic languages or to all those classified as ‘Semites’. The term has, however, since its inception referred to prejudice against Jews alone."

The unhyphenated spelling is preferred as a way to delegitimize the idea that antiseminism is inclusive of all Semitic people (e.g., non-Jewish Arabs, Assyrians, and Arameans).
