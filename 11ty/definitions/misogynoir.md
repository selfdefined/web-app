Coined by queer, Black feminist scholar Moya Bailey in 2008, misogynoir is a blend of the words “misogyny” (prejudice and discrimination towards women) and “noir” (a French word meaning Black).

Misogynoir describes how both sexism and racism uniquely affect Black women. In societies built on anti-Black racism, Black women are often not perceived as women. In addition to being Black, this perception creates a tension that encourages people to view Black women as less than human and dispensable.

Though coined by Moya Bailey, Trudy (aka @thetrudz) of Gradient Lair also impacted the spread and usage of the term.

## Issues

Feminist conversations around misogyny tend to center on white (and white-adjacent) women, with Black women often forgotten. In the early days of usage, people mistakenly used misogynoir to describe misogyny towards all women of color. Refrain from doing this, as misogynoir redirects attention and focuses on Black women’s unique experiences due to gender discrimination and anti-Black racism.

## Impact

Misogynoir is most often enacted in media, pop culture, and through state violence.

For an example of misogynoir in media, please read ["The Reaction to Megan Thee Stallion’s Alleged Shooting Is Misogynoir in Action: Experts"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj4m75/the-reaction-to-megan-thee-stallions-alleged-shooting-is-misogynoir-in-action-experts) by Manisha Krishnan to see an example of misogynoir against Megan Thee Stallion.
