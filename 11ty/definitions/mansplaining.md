A man explaining a topic to a woman in a condescending, overconfident way, without acknowledging the fact that the woman often knows more about that topic than the man doing the explaining. 

Examples include but aren't limited to: a man explaining to a woman how to pronounce her own name, explaining menstruation, or explaining the history of a country with which the woman is associated but the man has never been to.  

## Note

A good way to check if you're mansplaining is to ask yourself whether: 

(1) the person wants the explanation

(2) you are assuming incompetence, and, 

(3) how bias affects your interpretation of (1) and (2)
