The n-word is a euphemism for the term "nigger" or "nigga". It is considered _highly_ offensive for non-Black people to refer to anyone, especially Black people, as the "n-word", no matter the variant of the word. It has been reclaimed by Black people and is often used amongst themselves.

## Issues

The "n-word" was used to refer to enslaved Black people and later became normalized as a derogatory way to refer to Black people. The "n-word" was used in literature and other media. However, by the 1960s, the use of this term by non-Black people became widely recognized as offensive and inappropriate.
