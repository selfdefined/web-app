or, bi erasure; the questioning or denial of the existance or legitimacy of [Bisexuality](/definitions/bisexual); the shortened form of "bisexual erasure"

## Examples

- Telling a bi person that they're going through a phase or are confused
- Falsely connoting being bi with a certain sexual status or gender—bi people can be asexual, monogamous, polygamous and/or cis or trans, non-binary, agender, etc.
- Questioning our "queerness" because of our current partner (when a bi woman is with a man, for one example)
- Using phrases like "Bi now, gay later"
- Saying bisexuality isn't real
- Excluding us from LGBTQ+ conversations

## Impact

"Bi+ people experience discrimination from both heterosexual and sexual minority communities, related to repeatedly needing to “come out” as bi+.

This double discrimination can lead to isolation and loneliness, which can be harmful for mental health." — Sabra Katz-Wise
