### Filipino English ###
Salvage in local filipino slang means to murder and is often related to _extra-judicial killings_. The origins of this is disputed but common stories say the first time the term was introduced through a story of a woman being brually murdered in a junk shop. The shop was referred to as a _salvage area_ becausee people were not familiar with the term it was associated with murder.

Usage of the term became more common during the Marcos Dictatorship as forced dissapearances and extra-judicial killings became a common way for the dictatorship to squash dissent.
