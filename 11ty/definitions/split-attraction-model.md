a way of describing attraction as two separate things: romantic attraction and sexual attraction.

## Note

Used by many (but not all) people on the asexuality spectrum or aromantic spectrum, as well as many bisexual and pansexual people (though not exclusive to any of these identities), the split attraction model is one way to describe not experiencing both sexual and romantic attraction, or not experiencing both in the same way.

For example, an asexual person may experience romantic attraction but not sexual attraction, someone who is aromantic may experience sexual attraction but not romantic attraction, and someone who is bisexual may experience romantic attraction to some genders and sexual attraction to others.
