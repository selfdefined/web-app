Latinx arose as a gender-neutral alternative to the gendered [Latino/Latina](/definitions/latino) in the United States.

This is a term that is seeing expanded usage and evolution among academic circles. Latinx is considered a pan-ethnic term that does not provide context for someone's language, country of origin, or race.

#### Note

People who self-identify as Latinx may also self-identify as Chicano/Chicana, [Hispanic](/definitions/hispanic), or [Latin American](/definitions/latino)
