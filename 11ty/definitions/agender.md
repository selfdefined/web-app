An agender person is someone for whom one or more of the following is true:

- They are genderless, or without a gender
- Their gender is neutral (neither a man nor a woman)
- Their gender is undefineable using the binary gender model
- They don't know, understand, or care about their gender
- They don't want to label their gender

The term "non-binary" is often used to include agender people. While some agender people are also non-binary, not every agender person is comfortable being called non-binary or included in "non-binary" as an umbrella term.
