Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (initialised to ADHD) is a neurodivergence that expresses itself as a lack of impulse control at two extremes. It is commonly identified in children by their inability to remain focused on tasks that disinterests them. At the other end of the expressions, a person with ADHD has the ability to "hyperfocus" on a task that highly interests them. The following traits are examples of hyperfocus:

- performing hyperfocused tasks for an extraordinary amount of time
- becoming unresponsive to outside prompts (even to body signals like the need to eat or sleep)
- repetition of tasks to "perfection" rather than "good enough"
  
Naturally there could be positive outcomes when someone with ADHD hyperfocuses on beneficial tasks (e.g. studying a musical piece for an upcoming recital). In contrast, hyperfocus on non-beneficial tasks (like staying up late playing video games) can have the opposite effect. ADHD is a lifelong condition that some professionals believe should not be "cured". Rather the recommendation is to help the person with ADHD build coping mechanisms to direct their hyperfocus on beneficial tasks and minimize the impact of non-beneficial tasks.

## Appropriate Usage

People with ADHD often experience some combination of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is a diagnosable neurodivergence that affects both children and adults. What used to be diagnosed as either ADD or ADHD is now a single diagnosis called ADHD. ADHD has a few distinct subtypes: Inattentive, Hyperactive, and combined type.

## Inappropriate Usage

People often say "I'm so ADD/ADHD" when they're referring to short periods of hyperactivity or inability to focus. It's used colloquially much like "I'm so OCD," and has many of the same negative ramifications for neurodivergent folks.

When people think of ADHD, they think of a very specific character. This character is almost always an able-bodied white boy, and he is usually hyperactive and extremely distractible. In TV, movies, and books, ADHD characters are almost always played by white boys, and the emphasis is on their tendency to get into trouble or their inability to listen to instructions.

## Alt Usage

Rather than saying "I was so ADD/ADHD" when meant without the medical diagnosis context, instead use:

- distracted
- foggy
- hyper
- unclear
- unfocused

## Impact

The long-time emphasis on the hyperactive subtype of ADHD has resulted in a lot of gender and racial inequity in ADHD diagnosis and treatment. To [parahprase Ren√© Brooks](https://blackgirllostkeys.com/rene-brooks/), it's very difficult for women, especially Black women, to obtain a proper diagnosis and treatment for their ADHD. Traits like inattentiveness and hyperfocus can be harder to recognize than the hallmark hyperactivity, which results in missed diagnoses in girls and women.

The casual usage of ADHD to refer to occasional focus or hyperactivity issues creates the stigma that ADHD is a "fixable", "temporary", or "fake" mental state that you grow out of, rather than a chronic neurodivergence that can involve medical treatment. As is the case with many disorders, the symptoms and behaviors can happen to many people regardless of diagnosis. What results in a diagnosis is when those symptoms create a significant impairment in someone's ability to function on a regular basis and they have access and means to obtaining that care.
