the advantage/s white people have due to living in a society constructed to favour them

## Note

White privilege is not earned but something some people are born into because of the colour of their skin. Having white privilege doesn't mean life is always easy, but, in that instance, skin colour wouldn't be one of the things making life hard.

## Examples

Within a country with a predominantly white population, the following statements, for example, would be true for people with white skin but not for people of colour:

- I can turn on the TV, open a magazine, search for an image online, buy birthday cards, and so on, and see people who look like me widely and positively represented.
- When I learn or am reminded about our national history, or even about that of "civilization", I will be shown that people who look like me made it what it is.
- I can buy plasters and easily have them more or less match my skin colour.
- If I need financial help, I can be sure my skin colour won't negatively affect my chances of receiving it.
- I am more likely to be hired and promoted than a Black or brown contemporary, and my wage will likely be higher for comparable jobs.
- At work, I can be pretty confident I won't be challenged about my natural hair shape or the way I manage it.
- I can be pretty confident I won't be stopped and searched by the police.  I am less likely to be killed by the police than if I were Black or brown. I am less likely to be convicted of a crime than I would if I were Black or brown - and, if I am convicted, the sentence I receive is likely to be smaller. I am less likely to go to prison.
- I won't have my citizenship challenged.

## Issue

As with [white fragility(/definitions/white-fragility/)], a focus on white privilege can be distracting from systemic racism. Additionally, caution needs to taken because the phrase can make it sound like whiteness is best.
