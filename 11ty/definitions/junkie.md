a drug addict; a person who suffers from a complex disease of the brain and body that involves compulsive use of one or more substances despite serious health and social consequences

## Issues

Junkie is commonly used as a term for someone whose enthusiasm or zeal for something may be considered extreme or beyond normal interest by others. However, this diminishes the seriousness of drug addiction and substance use disorder.

## Impact

By using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental or psychological disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.
