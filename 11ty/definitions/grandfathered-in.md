To permit to continue under expired rules

## Issues

In the United States, ‘Grandfather Clause’ originally referred to provisions adopted by seven Southern states after the Civil War in an effort to disenfranchise African-American voters by requiring voters to pass literacy tests or meet other significant qualifications, while exempting from such requirements those who were descendants of men who were eligible to vote before 1867. This type of law ensured that illiterate whites were able to vote while restricting Black Americans from voting.  This practice of grandfather clauses did not officially end until 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was implemented.

## Impact

The modern use of the phrase "grandfathered in" ignores its racist roots and normalizes a term that enfranchised white Americans and restricted Black Americans from voting.  Refraining to use this term is an acknowledgement of its history and a dedication to inclusivity by avoiding inciting images of racism out of context.

## Usage Tip

Use a neutral word like 'legacy' instead, or be more specific about the circumstances.  Rather than saying 'those customers were grandfathered in to the 2017 pricing schedule', rephrase it to 'those customers have retained the pricing schedule from 2017 due to the terms of service at the time' or 'those customers are on a legacy pricing plan from 2017.
