a set of words that go alongside traditional third-person pronouns (he/she/singular they) such as ze/zir, ze/hir, xe/xem, and plural they.

## Note

Some people find using neopronouns helpful to disrupting the gender binary, as traditional pronouns he and she usually carry connotations of male/masculine and female/feminine and they can carry connotations of being non-binary. Neopronouns are not recognised "officially" in the English language and tend to be less known as a result of their newness and lack of institutional support.
